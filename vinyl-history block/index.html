                                <p>The biggest selling album of all time is Michael Jackson's Thriller, with 32 million copies sold worldwide in the first year. 
                                    It's estimated the total number of sales to date now stands at over 70 million. </p>

                                <p>Based on when the CD was introduced in 1982, and the fact it didn't surpass vinyl in sales numbers until 1986,

                                    <p>The title of the world's largest record collection goes to Brazillian businessman José Roberto Alves Freitas. On the last count, his collection stood at over 6 million and counting back in 2016. 
                                        He regularly buys entire collections he finds through Ads in what can only be described as an extreme case of compulsive record-buying disorder!
                                       <br>  Who knows how large the collection is today. He even has an entire team of people who spend 8 hours a day cleaning and archiving his collection.     
                                        Getting through the entire hoard is no small task, and they'll likely never achieve it. Crazy!</p>

                                        <p><b>Brush up on your knowledge of vinyl records with these fun facts.</b></p>

                                        <p>There is a national day devoted to vinyl records called National Vinyl Record Day. It falls annually on August 12th.
                                            The term “like a broken record” doesn't actually refer to a broken record, it refers to a scratched record. When a record has a scratch, the needle can become stuck in that scratch, and play the same thing over and over, which is the true meaning of the phrase “like a broken record”.
                                            </p>
